# Combo Burst

Have any character cheer on you as you get further in the level!  
Inspired by osu's combo burst.

Art and SFX belong to their respective owners.

# Sprite Packs

You can change the characters popping up by editing the settings:

[1] Anime Pack  

[2] Meme Pack  

[0] Custom Sprite Pack (see below)

More packs coming soon!

## Custom Sprites
If you want to add your own sprites, create a folder in the mod's save folder named "custom-sprite" and add your sprites there.
Each character must have two files:
1. `comboburst-1.png` - The sprite that will be displayed.
2. `comboburst-1.wav` - The sound that will be played. (.wav, .ogg, mp3, etc.)

All sprites with a running number starting from 1 will be loaded.
(Example: `comboburst-1.png`, `comboburst-2.png`, `comboburst-3.png`, etc.)
