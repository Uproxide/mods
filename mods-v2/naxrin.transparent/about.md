# Transparent Background

This mod removes stupid blue blending of background image and shitty yellow list background in several menu pages and let us able to enjoy the raw anime background we pick.
In addition, you can customize loading circle colors to fix your background theme.
Also you can switch to dark theme for gauntlet/daily/weekly levels.

Will consider customizing the background color by your own or something else.

Neither of us have a mac so this mod is not yet confirmed to work well in mac. Contact Naxrin via GD message if the mod breaks down on your mac.
