# Jumpscare

Randomly jumpscares you when you die

My **attempt** at recreating MegaHack's Jumpscare module

You can change the **behavior** of the mod in the mod settings

# How to change/add your own jumpscare

To <cl>access this mod's config folder</c>, click the pencil button next to the mod settings button below.

To <cr>add your own jumpscare</c>, make a new folder in the config folder and add your assets in it.

The assets must include 2 files: `"jumpscare.png"` for the jumpscare image, and `"jumpscareAudio.mp3"` for the jumpscare audio.

## <cr>For now the jumpscares are chosen at random, I will probably add an option to choose a specific jumpscare to use in a future update</c>

Example files structure:
```
config/weebify.jumpscare/
    jumpscare/
        jumpscare.png
        jumpscareAudio.mp3
    gdcologne/
        jumpscare.png
        jumpscareAudio.mp3
```
