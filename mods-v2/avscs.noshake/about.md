# NoShake

Disables shake for all levels similar to `Enable LDM` in the default settings.

## What is changed?

The default `Disable Shake` option is now a global setting. By default this global setting is enabled. You can change this global setting in the **Mod Settings** menu (`Geode > NoShake > Settings`). If this is on, shake triggers have no effect and the `Disable Shake` option cannot be toggled off. If this is off, then `Disable Shake` will function like it normally does.
