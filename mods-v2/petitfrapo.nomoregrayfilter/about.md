# NoMoreGrayFilter

Removes the filthy gray filter from the Event, Map and Versus button. Should be compatible with any mod, but please report any issue on the [GitHub repo](https://www.github.com/PetitFrapo/NoMoreGrayFilter). Cosmetic only of course.
Thank you very much RayDeeUx for the bug fixes!
