# Auto Deafen

This mod allows you to deafen when going to a certain percentage in a level

# How to use

1. Set the deafen percentage to whatever you like.
2. Go to Discord and bind the deafen key to `PgUp (or RePag in spanish keyboards)`. (this will be changed in a future update)

# Notes

- The mod is going to get updated to support custom keybinds instead of forcing you to set one.
- Bug reports for this mod should go to my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/vfFazvmKKb) or in the mod's Github repository.
