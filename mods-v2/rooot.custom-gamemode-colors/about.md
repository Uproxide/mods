# Custom Gamemode Colors

Change colors of your player based on your current gamemode!

Use the 2nd color menu in the icon kit to set overrides.
Overrides have to be manually enabled for each gamemode through the 7 buttons at the top.
To override the colors of a specific gamemode, click its icon and then the colors you want to set as you would normally do.

Happy (colorful) dashing! :3
