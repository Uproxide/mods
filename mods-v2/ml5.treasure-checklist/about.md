# Treasure Checklist
Displays a list of the Icon rewards you have collected (or have yet to collect) from each type of Secret Chest in the Treasure Room.

### Settings
* Show miscellaneous rewards.
* Disable checkmark.

### Note
Since this is my first Geode mod, it's unknown if its compatible with any mod that modifies the button layout of the GarageLayer. Will work on compatibility and code optimization when I can.
