# DisturbingNewBests Changelog
## v1.1.0
- Added linewrapping support. Thanks sofabeddd!
- Added option to hide rewards animation on death.
- Added "Max Scale" option.
- *Technically*, this is the initial release for the Geode index, but there have been several notable changes between v1.0.0 and v1.1.0 that it's best to release a new version now to make sure everyone updates to this version.
## v1.0.0
- Initial release (for GitHub).
