# High Graphics on Android

Adds support for High graphics (and Low as well if you like lol) on Android

Also adds the graphics button in the options layer so you can show your FPS in the advanced menu

I recommend downloading all the high graphics textures [here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/zketobikxoo0l4e/high-textures.zip/file), and load it using Texture Loader, as Android doesn't have the high textures by default

## as of now please unzip the high-textures.zip file as texture loader doesn't appear to load some of the textures in the zip file

Special thanks to CatXus and Jaid for testing this mod with me! :D
