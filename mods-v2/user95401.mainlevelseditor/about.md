# Main Levels Editor

u can edit:
- main levels setup (stars, song, name, difficulty)
- bg color for page
- songs
- pages in level select layer (here is a fake page list)

and <cr>"Load Failed!"</c> <cl>bypass</c> here

<cg>summary u can add ur own level in level select layer</c>

settings here is generating per hooked functions call 
so play stereo madness to generate all config structure

<cr>

#### android releases is unstable i think
