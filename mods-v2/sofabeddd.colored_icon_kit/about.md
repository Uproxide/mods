# Colored Icon Kit

## Developer Announcements
This is just a quick push to get my April Fools update out. Big changes coming soon in `v2.0.0`, but it's taking a little longer than I thought and index wait times are all over the place. Also, a huge thanks to everyone for **64000** downloads on my mod; I never imagined it would get this popular.

For the Mac compatibility, the Icon Kit does not support color refreshing but other than that the functionality is the same. 

Thanks, sofabeddd
